<p>The log file contents are a sequence of 32KB blocks. The only exception is that the tail of the file may contain a partial block.</p>
<p>Each block consists of a sequence of records: block := record* trailer? record := checksum: uint32 // crc32c of type and data[] ; little-endian length: uint16 // little-endian type: uint8 // One of FULL, FIRST, MIDDLE, LAST data: uint8[length]</p>
<p>A record never starts within the last six bytes of a block (since it wonâ€™t fit). Any leftover bytes here form the trailer, which must consist entirely of zero bytes and must be skipped by readers.</p>
<p>Aside: if exactly seven bytes are left in the current block, and a new non-zero length record is added, the writer must emit a FIRST record (which contains zero bytes of user data) to fill up the trailing seven bytes of the block and then emit all of the user data in subsequent blocks.</p>
<p>More types may be added in the future. Some Readers may skip record types they do not understand, others may report that some data was skipped.</p>
<p>FULL == 1 FIRST == 2 MIDDLE == 3 LAST == 4</p>
<p>The FULL record contains the contents of an entire user record.</p>
<p>FIRST, MIDDLE, LAST are types used for user records that have been split into multiple fragments (typically because of block boundaries). FIRST is the type of the first fragment of a user record, LAST is the type of the last fragment of a user record, and MIDDLE is the type of all interior fragments of a user record.</p>
<p>Example: consider a sequence of user records: A: length 1000 B: length 97270 C: length 8000 A will be stored as a FULL record in the first block.</p>
<p>B will be split into three fragments: first fragment occupies the rest of the first block, second fragment occupies the entirety of the second block, and the third fragment occupies a prefix of the third block. This will leave six bytes free in the third block, which will be left empty as the trailer.</p>
<p>C will be stored as a FULL record in the fourth block.</p>
<p>===================</p>
<p>Some benefits over the recordio format:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>We do not need any heuristics for resyncing - just go to next block boundary and scan. If there is a corruption, skip to the next block. As a side-benefit, we do not get confused when part of the contents of one log file are embedded as a record inside another log file.</p></li>
<li><p>Splitting at approximate boundaries (e.g., for mapreduce) is simple: find the next block boundary and skip records until we hit a FULL or FIRST record.</p></li>
<li><p>We do not need extra buffering for large records.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Some downsides compared to recordio format:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>No packing of tiny records. This could be fixed by adding a new record type, so it is a shortcoming of the current implementation, not necessarily the format.</p></li>
<li><p>No compression. Again, this could be fixed by adding new record types.</p></li>
</ol>
